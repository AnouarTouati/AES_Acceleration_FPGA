# AES_Acceleration_FPGA
System design based on DE-10 board, 
This project is our Master's graduation project.
<br> The aim is to integrate an already existing AES block in the FPGA(DE-10Standard board) fabric then bridge it to HPS(ARM), the latter access video ports read data send it to AES block, retrieve the encrypted data and save it.
